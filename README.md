# Chronos Control

Evaluations are an important part of research and development. While they are daily business for every database engineer, most engineers are recurrently facing the same problems: How to automate, monitor and analyze the results in a straightforward and intuitive way and how to guarantee reproducibility? With Chronos we have developed an evaluation system which presents a solution to these major challenges.
